- We enter the room and see several members of the cast around - `Timpy Toque`, `Rose Mold`, `Eve Snowshoes`, `Smilegol`, `Angel Candysalt`, and of course, `Santa` himself.

- We talk to everyone, and after speaking with Santa, the beautiful end credits play on screen.

- I want to thank everyone on the SANS team for such an outstanding and enjoyable event each year. This is the first that I actually set aside some time to document my progress, but I truly enjoy the challenge every year, and hope it continues to grow.
