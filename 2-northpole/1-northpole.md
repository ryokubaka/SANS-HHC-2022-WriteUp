# The North Pole

![](0-northpoleentrance.png)

After entering the North Pole, we see Santa in front of us. He tells us that he's lost his `Five Golden Rings`, and without them we can't launch the holiday season. He puts us on the official quest to find and return these rings to him in order to save the holidays (and.. the whole world, apparently)! 

We're given 5 objectives in our badge to collect the five rings below. The links will take you to the write-ups for how we capture the rings!

## Secret Backroom

Walking around/exploring, I find a secret room behind the building on the left hand side.

We see a `Santa Magic` terminal. The terminal has a picture of Santa who claims that even though we were told the private key to our wallet couldn't be recovered, he could, but we need to prove ourselves first. He tells us to go on a quest to find Yukon Conrnelius to find what he calls a `Bumble`. .... Well, I'll just paste the rest of his long dialogue here, but long story short - he just tells us our key at the end, which means we can come back here if we ever happen to lose it.

```
Take a tooth from the Bumble and carry it deep
into the Misty Mountains, and trade it with Gwairhair,
Windlord of the Great Eagles, for one of his feathers.

If Gwairhair is reluctant to trade,
tell him that I have sent you.

With that feather, you must scale the walls of Sombertown,
and find the home of Burgermeister Meisterburger.

Take the feather, and tickle Burgermeister Meisterburger,
so that he may laugh and feel joy!

Once he feels joy, he'll happily give you
safe passage to the Isle of Misfit Toys...

There, you must find Dolly, and tell her that a horrible
mistake has been made and she's perfectly fine...

Not a misfit at all...

Thus, having set right one of the greatest wrongs
of the Christmas season, you will
have proved yourself worthy!

Then, if you come back here, I will tell you...

...that your key is

Write it down, NOW, mmmmmkay?

Looking around the space, we see three paths - in the center leads to a labyrinth, to the northeast leads to a closed door (with Chimney Scissorsticks standing to the right of it), and to the southeast is another closed door.

The only path we can go into is the [North Pole Subterranean Labyrinth](2-labyrinth.md).
