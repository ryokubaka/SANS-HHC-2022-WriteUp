# North Pole Subterranean Labyrinth

We go down a long ladder and see to the left the `Hall of Talks` room that hosts all of our Security experts Youtube talks. However, walking past the talks, we see a juicy chest!

This gave us some coins, and this nice hint:

Going back out and down further, we see a room to the right and `Grinchum` to the left. Off further left is another ladder further down. Talking to Grinchum doesn't give us any info, just something about his *precious*.

Let's head into the [Tolkien Ring room](3-rings/1-tolkien/README.md).

After we've captured the Tolkien Ring, we continue down the labyrinth past Grinchum.

We see `Morcel Nougat`, and the Elfen Ring room. Morcel doesn't tell us much, so we head into the [Elfen Ring room](../3-rings/2-elfen/README).

---
After grabbing the Elfen Ring, we head deeper into the labyrinth.

We find `Tangle Coalbox` and the Web Ring room. Tangle says some nonsense about Flobbits. Let's head into the [Web Ring room](3-web/README).

---
Now that we've secured 3 of the 5 rings, we head back out and to the left. As I was about to go deeper down, I noticed a rope to the left. So, we climb up and to left to find a chest!

Now we head a little bit deeper into the labyrinth, and find the `Cloud Ring` room to our left, along with `Brozeek` and `Crozag` chilling to our right.

Into the [`Cloud Room`](../3-rings/4-cloud/README) we go!
