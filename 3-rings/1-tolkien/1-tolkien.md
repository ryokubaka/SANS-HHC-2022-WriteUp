# Tolkien Ring Room - Northpole Subterranean Labyrinth

Inside the room, we find 3 characters and 3 challenges:

1. `Sparkle Redberry` stands next to the [`Wireshark Phishing`](suspiciouspcap/solution.md) terminal
2. `Dusty Giftwrap` stands next to the [`Windows Event Logs`](windowseventlogs/solution.md) terminal
3. `Fitzy Shortstack` stands next to some crazy monster, and asks us to format some Suricata rules.
