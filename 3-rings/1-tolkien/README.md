# Tolkien Ring Room - Northpole Subterranean Labyrinth

Inside the room, we find 3 characters and 3 challenges:

1. `Sparkle Redberry` stands next to the [`Wireshark Phishing`](suspiciouspcap/README.md) terminal
2. `Dusty Giftwrap` stands next to the [`Windows Event Logs`](windowseventlogs/README.md) terminal
3. `Fitzy Shortstack` stands next to some crazy monster, and asks us to format some Suricata rules. It's a [`Suricata Regatta`](suricataregatta/README.md)!

After we solve these 3 challenges, we've captured the glorious **Tolkien Ring**.  Talking to `Fitzy Shortstack` causes the big monster to our right to move out of the way, but we can't go further.

Let's head back to the [labyrinth](../../2-northpole/2-labyrinth.md).
